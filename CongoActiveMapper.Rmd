## Background









A crop field in the congo 

-This project builds upon the work done on the Mapping Africa project. 
-The project seeks to implement the exsting Active Learning Framwork from Ghana to the Congo
-The project is computational powered by AWS (EC2 for compute and S3 for storage) and has a large human feedbackloop.There are four major mapping components: 
    1) image acquisition and pre-processing, 2) training data, 3) machine learning, and 4) segmentation. 











Above is the overal AOI

## 1 image acquisition - Noah
  -The first stage is Image acquisition
  -This was completed using EC2 and Planet Scope Imagery.Planet Scope Satellites are box satellites provide high temporal and spatial resolution for cropland identifciation.  
  - two time frames the dry season (December-February) and the wet season (May - September) (Estes 7)
  











Composite Image right is growing season and left is nongrowing season

## 2 Training data collection -Priyanka and Wei Hong















-The Images were then process in EC2, 200 training sites were randomly selected from the AOI
-the sites are then stored in postgrse. 












-Traning site classfiers from the spatial collective in africa access a OpenLayers.The classifiers from the -spatial collec work on creating tranning and validtion data


















-Settlement Locations (datafromHDX) and the buffer sights

##Machine learning/ (Future)
-Apart of future steps in mapping the cropland of congo
-In this stage the human / machine and machine connection is established 
-A "custom crowdsourcing platfrom" is created(Estes 8)

-This platfrom is called labeller wich is built around human asserors that complete tasks
    This includes building data for understanding accuracry and also data for tranning
- Mapper is established for classfication 










- Mapper is a random forrest algthrim that has 80 trees

---

##Conclusion
-The final two steps are the active feedback loop and segmentation
-This segmentation (field segmentation) step is powered by a meanshift algorithm (Yizong Cheng 1995) and followed up by a accuracy assessment
-The challange of creating a automated system for cropland segmentaion in heaivly forested and remote area
-requires care towards accuarcy and limiting factors
