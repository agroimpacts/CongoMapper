## Background


A crop field in the congo 

-This project builds upon the work done on the Mapping Africa project. \n
-The project seeks to implement the exsting Active Learning Framwork from Ghana to the Congo \n
-The project is computational powered by AWS (EC2 for compute and S3 for storage) and has a large human feedbackloop.There are four major mapping components: \n
    1) image acquisition and pre-processing \n
    2) training data \n
    3) machine learning \n
    4) segmentation 











Above is the overal AOI

## 1 Image acquisition - Noah
  -The first stage is Image acquisition
  -This was completed using EC2 and Planet Scope Imagery.Planet Scope Satellites are box satellites provide high temporal and spatial resolution for cropland identification. \n
  - Two time frames: \n
     1) Dry season (December-February) \n
     2) Wet season (May - September)
  











Composite image on the right is growing season, and on the left is non-growing season.

## 2 Training data collection -Priyanka and Wei Hong


-The images were then process in Amazon EC2, 200 training sites were randomly selected from the AOIs. \n
-The sites are then stored in postgres. 




-Training site classfiers from the spatial collective in Africa access a OpenLayers.The classifiers from the -spatial collect work on creating training and validation data.



-Settlement Locations (datafromHDX) and the buffer sights

## Machine learning/ (Future)
-In this stage the human / machine and machine connection is established \n
-A "custom crowdsourcing platfrom" is created(Estes 8)

-This platfrom is called labeller wich is built around human assessors that complete tasks, includes building data for understanding accuracy and data training
- Mapper is established for classfication, which uses a random forest algorithm. In this case, it has 80 trees.

## Conclusion
-The final two steps are the active feedback loop and segmentation
-This segmentation (field segmentation) step is powered by a meanshift algorithm (Yizong Cheng 1995) and followed up by a accuracy assessment
-The challange of creating a automated system for cropland segmentaion in heavily forested and remote area
-Requires care towards accuarcy and limiting factors
