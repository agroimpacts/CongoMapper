## Background









A crop field in the congo 

This project builds upon the work done on the Mapping Africa project. 
The project seeks to implement the exsting Active Learning Framwork from Ghana to the Congo
 The project is computational powered by AWS (EC2 for compute and S3 for storage) and has a large human feedbackloop.There are four major mapping components: 1) image acquisition and pre-processing, 2) training data, 3) machine learning, and 4) segmentation. 










Above is the overal AOI 

## 1 image acquisition - Noah
The first stag is Image acquisition
  This was completed using EC2 and Planet Scope Imagery. Planets box satellites provide a great set of images for cropland identifciation. 
  








Composite Image right is growing season and left is nongrowing season


## 2 Training data collection -Priyanka and Wei Hong














The Images were then process in EC2, 200 training sites were randomly selected from the AOI
the sites are then stored in postgrse. 












Traning site classfiers from the spatial collective in africa access a OpenLayers.The classifiers from the spatial collec work on creating tranning and validtion data
